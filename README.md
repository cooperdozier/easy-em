# Easy Em responsive JavaScript menu/submenu system

Make sure you try narrowing and widening the window if you're on a desktop or laptop and viewing in both portrait and landscape on a smartphone or tablet. Some smartphones will not display the widescreen format even in landscape.

To add and remove menu items that will be visible but without extra space in all states, just change 3 JavaScript height values (instructions and annotations in [from-scratch-menu-annotated.js](main/js/from-scratch-menu-annotated.js) and add/remove the code for the new menu entries in the HTML files. 

Also included are a set of Facebook Open Graph and Twitter meta tags, the best I've been able to puzzle out the currently used syntax, and limited to those that seemed like they might be applicable to any web page.

It optionally integrates with the full set of Pure CSS framework rules, if you just comment out my 'purecss-stripped.css' and uncomment the CDN stylesheet links in the HTML. Also, the CDN links are for Pure 3.0.0 while mine were taken from Pure 2.0.3. Not sure if there are any significant differences in the ones I included yet.

**For Novices:**
***If you have never used GitHub before, the way to get the code is: click the green Code button, click Download Zip, extract it on your computer, and double click either HTML file.***

I built this for my site, [SaveTheOxygen.org](savetheoxygen.org) which is about Ocean Hypoxia and Climate Change, after I couldn't find a way to adapt the horizontal to vertical menu from the example at [https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/](https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/) that I had been using, such that it allows for menu items exceeding the window's horizontal width.
