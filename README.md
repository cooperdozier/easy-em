To add and remove menu items that will be visible but without extra space in all states, just change 3 JavaScript height values (instructions and annotations in [from-scratch-menu-annotated.js](https://github.com/cooperdozier/easy-em/blob/main/js/from-scratch-menu-annotated.js) and add/remove the code for the new menu entries in the HTML files. 

built this for my site, savetheoxygen.org about Ocean Hypoxia and Climate Change, after I couldn't find a way to adapt the example horizontal to vertical menu from the example at [https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/](https://purecss.io/layouts/tucked-menu-vertical/) that I had been using, to allow for menu items exceeding the window's horizontal width.

# For Novices:
## ***If you have never used GitHub before, the way to get the code is: click the green Code button, click Download Zip, extract it on your computer, and double click either HTML file.***
